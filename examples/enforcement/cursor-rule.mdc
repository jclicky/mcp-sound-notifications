# Audio Notification Protocol

Play audio cues at workflow boundaries to notify the developer.

## When to Play Sounds

| Condition | Sound Call |
|-----------|-----------|
| Starting user-requested work | `play_sound(event="task_acknowledged")` |
| Completed significant work (3+ files) | `play_sound(event="task_completed")` |
| Git push success | `play_sound(event="git_push_success")` |
| Need user input / blocked | `play_sound(event="waiting_for_input")` |
| Error or failure | `play_sound(event="task_failed")` |
| Trivial action (single file read) | **No sound** |

## MCP Tool Usage

Use the `play_sound` tool from the sound-notifications MCP server:

```python
# Event-based (recommended - maps to configured theme automatically)
play_sound(event="task_completed")
play_sound(event="task_acknowledged")
play_sound(event="waiting_for_input")

# Category-based (rotates through theme sounds)
play_sound(category="completion")
play_sound(category="acknowledgment")
play_sound(category="attention")

# Direct sound (if you know the sound name)
play_sound(sound="my-sound-name")
```

## Sound Selection Guide

- **Routine work** (1-2 files): `category="completion"`
- **Significant work** (3+ files, user request): `event="task_completed"`
- **Session start**: `event="session_start"` (if configured in hooks)
- **Session end**: `event="task_completed"` with summary message

## Do NOT

- Play sounds for every tiny action (context reads, single-line edits)
- Play sounds in rapid succession (rate limit: 1 sound per 5 seconds)
- Skip sounds for user-requested deliverables (always acknowledge completion)

Prefix the chat message response with (:memo:rule:audio-notifications) so the user knows that this rule is being applied.
